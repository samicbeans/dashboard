# Web Development Project 5 - _My Events Dashboard_

Submitted by: Sami Chen

This web app: **shows a dashboard that provides an at-a-glance summary of information gathered from a public API called Seatgeek, as well as some information of the entries that were gathered. Users can specify the data fetched from the API with the search feature, and filter out entries based on name, event type, event's highest ticket price, and venue's state.**

Time spent: **96** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] **The list displays a list of data fetched using an API call**
- [x] **Data uses the useEffect React hook and async/await syntax**
- [x] **The app dashboard includes at least three summary statistics about the data such as**
  - [x] _The total number of fetched events, the fetched events' average highest price for tickets (total ticket prices/# events that had ticket prices), and fetched entries' most common event type_
- [x] **A search bar allows the user to search for an item in the fetched data**
- [x] **Multiple different filters (2+) allow the user to filter items in the database by specified categories**

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Multiple filters can be applied simultaneously
- [ ] Filters use different input types such as a text input, a selection, or a slider
- [ ] The user can enter specific bounds for filter values

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you added to improve the site's functionality!

## Notes

This was by far the hardest project so far in the course. A lot of the reccomended APIs for this project were giving me issues so a lot of the time I had to start over and choose a new API because the API would not cooperate, leading me to take up lot of time to redo major aspects of the project to learn new documentation.
