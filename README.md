# Web Development Project 6 - _My Events Dashboard Part 2_

Submitted by: Sami Chen

This web app: **shows a dashboard that provides an at-a-glance summary of information gathered from a public API called Seatgeek, as well as some information of the entries that were gathered. Users can specify the data fetched from the API with the search feature, and filter out entries based on name, event type, event's highest ticket price, and venue's state. In addition it provides a chart of the average ticket cost for the dataset of events based on the date of the event. Users can click on a event's title to see a webpage that has more detailed information about that event.**

Time spent: **72** hours spent in total

## Notes

My main troubles were with learning the documentation for Recharts and how to use it to create a chart, and figuring out what kind of data I want to display for that chart.
